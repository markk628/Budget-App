## How It Works
* User logs in or signs up (the user is saved in Firebase Authentication database)
* There are two options on the tabbar: Charts and Expenses
* User can save their expenses on the expenses tab (expenses are saved in Cloud Firestore)
* Expenses can be represented on either a pie char or bar char (Charts Pod)
## Tools
* Firebase
* Cloud Firestore
